# task_management_system_server
Task Management System
A simple task management application where users can register, create, read, update, delete tasks, and filter them by status and due date. Built using React.js for the frontend and Express.js for the backend with MongoDB for the database.

Features
User Registration: Users can register to the application.
Task Management: Users can create, read, update, and delete tasks.
Filters: Tasks can be filtered based on status (e.g., Pending, In Progress, Completed) and due date.


Installation
Clone the repository

https://github.com/GhulamAbbasKazmi/task_management_system_server.git

Install dependencies

Go to the project directory in the terminal and install the required dependencies 
npm install


Start the backend server:

npm run dev

Usage
Registration: Users can register via the /register endpoint on the backend.
Task Management: Once registered, users can perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on tasks via the /tasks endpoint.
Filters: Tasks can be filtered by status (Pending, In Progress, Completed) and due date.



Challenges Faced
I implemented this task management system with the help of the official React.js documentation. The docs provided clear guidance and examples that helped me solve problems related to managing state, handling forms, and integrating with APIs. Additionally, I also referred to Express.js documentation for building the backend APIs and MongoDB documentation for setting up the database.
